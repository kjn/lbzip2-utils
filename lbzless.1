.TH LBZLESS 1
.SH NAME
lbzless \- file perusal filter for crt viewing of compressed text
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B lbzless
[ name ...  ]
.SH DESCRIPTION
.I  Lbzless
is a filter which allows examination of compressed or plain text files
one screenful at a time on a soft-copy terminal.  It is the equivalent of
setting the environment variable LESSOPEN to '|lbzip2 -cdq -- %s',
and the environment variable LESSMETACHARS to
\&'<space><tab><newline>;*?"()<>[|&^`#\e$%=~',
and then running
.IR less .
However, enough people seem to think that having the
command
.I lbzless
available is important to be worth providing it.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
lbzmore(1), less(1)
.SH "BUGS"
.I Lbzless
does not work with compressed data that is piped to it via standard
input; it requires that input files be specified as arguments.
To read compressed data from a pipe, you can use
.RB ".\|.\|." "|lbunzip2|less"
instead of
.RB ".\|.\|." "|lbzless" .
